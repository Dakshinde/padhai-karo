# Padhai Karo - Your Personalized Engineering Tutor 

An intelligent learning assistant built with Streamlit and powered by the Gemini API to help engineering students identify weak areas and improve their understanding through personalized quizzes and study plans.


## About The Project

In today‚Äôs fast-paced education environment, students often struggle to identify their personal weak areas without continuous performance analysis. Padhai Karo is an intelligent learning assistant that helps bridge the gap between testing and effective learning. It tracks a student's quiz performance, identifies weak topics using AI, and recommends targeted study materials and personalized learning paths that adapt to their needs.
